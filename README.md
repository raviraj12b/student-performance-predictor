## Overview

This project predicts a student's average exam score (out of 100) using 5 demographic and preparation features:

- Gender
- Race / Ethnicity
- Parental level of education
- Lunch type (socioeconomic indicator)
- Test preparation course completion

The app walks through the complete ML workflow — data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment — making it a fully production-structured machine learning project.

**Dataset:** [Students Performance in Exams — Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
1,000 student records · No missing values · 8 original features

## Model Performance

Four regression models were trained and evaluated on the same 80/20 split:

| Model                  |R² Score | MAE     | RMSE     | 
|------------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Linear Regression**  | 0.1622  | 10.4902 | 13.4016  |
| Decision Tree          |-0.0753  | 11.8081 |  15.1827 |
| Random Forest          | -0.0252 | 11.4884 | 14.8248  |
| Gradient Boosting      | 0.0858  | 10.832  | 13.9993  |

** Linear Regression** was selected as the best model with:
- **R² =  0.1622** — explains 80.84% of variance in student scores
- **MAE =10.4902** — predictions are off by ~3.5 points on average (0–100 scale)

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Git

### 1 — Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/student-performance-predictor.git
cd student-performance-predictor
```

### 2 — Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3 — Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4 — Add the dataset
Download [StudentsPerformance.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) from Kaggle and place it in:
```
data/raw/StudentsPerformance.csv
```

### 5 — Train the model
```bash
python train.py
```
This trains all 4 models, selects the best, and saves it to `models/model.pkl`.

### 6 — Run the web app
```bash
python app.py
```

## Key Insights from EDA

1. **No missing values** — dataset is clean with 1,000 complete records
2. **Test preparation course** has a strong positive effect across all 3 subjects
3. **Lunch type** is a significant socioeconomic predictor — standard lunch students score ~8 points higher on average
4. **Parental education** correlates positively with student performance — master's degree parents → highest scoring students
5. **Reading and writing scores** are highly correlated (r ≈ 0.95) — they carry nearly identical information
6. **Score distributions** are approximately normal — well-suited for regression models
7. **Gender gap** — females score higher in reading/writing; males slightly higher in math

## What I Learned

- Building an end-to-end ML pipeline from raw CSV to deployed web app
- Using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline` to prevent data leakage
- Comparing multiple regression models using R², MAE, and RMSE
- Structuring a Python project with `config.py`, `logger.py`, and separate training scripts
- Building a Flask app with form handling, server-side validation, and Jinja2 templating
- Writing production-aware code: logging, error handling, input validation
